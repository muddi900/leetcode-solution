# Python

- Solution at 46th percentile. The faster soltions seem to using list comprehensions, which are faster in Python. But unreadable.

# Go

- The go solution is even slower than python. Even in speed. Only beats 11%.(f745c382b7b07377d56bb5cbef56bd8cc18d61c8)
- There is clearly an issue with hashing in go.
- Switched to a slice and it became way fast.
